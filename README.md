    * Faster alternatives to `transmute()` with user-supplied column names:
    ```r
    # the following is inside a function
    # id, S1, and S2, are strings
    # diff and mean are numeric vectors
    output <- data %>%
      dplyr::transmute(id = .data[[id]],
             "{{variable}}_1" := data[[S1]],
             "{{variable}}_2" := data[[S2]],
             "{{variable}}_diff" := diff,
             "{{variable}}_mean" := mean)
   ```
